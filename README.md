# Crowdfunding_ET

We worked with the crowdfunding project. This included the data for campaigns and the contacts. 
The process of ETL - extract, transform and load was applied to clean, re-reformat and populate data for analysis. 

## Extract- 
Imported data from two Excel files, crowdfunding.xlsx and contacts.xlsx, into separate Pandas dataframes.

## Transform- 
Transformed these dataframes by cleaning data, handling missing values, renaming columns, converting data types, splitting columns, and creating new dataframes.

## Load-
Converted the transformed data into 4 CSV files - Campaign.csv, Categort.csv, Subcategory.csv, Contact.csv. and loaded into PostgreSQL database after building the schema. 

## Tools and Libraries Used
Python
Pandas
PostgreSQL
Jupyter Notebook
